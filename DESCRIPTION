Description: This package is used to calculate a matrix containing the semantic 
    similarity between the Gene Ontology annotations (GOs) in a list. Then this 
    matrix can be used to obtain a matrix with the similarities between the 
    Orthologous Groups (OGs) taking into consideration the GOs that belong to 
    each OG. This is provided by the user as a data.frame with two columns, one 
    with the GOs and the other with the OGs. This package can also be used to 
    annotate the OGs by obtaining the descriptions for the ontologies (BP, MF, 
    CC) selected by the user. Finally, using the similarity matrix and the 
    annotations a plot with the constellations, clusters of OGs, is provided.
